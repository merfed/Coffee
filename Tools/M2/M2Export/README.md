# Maya .NET M2 Export Plugin

***Work in Progress, plugin not available yet***

## How to use this plugin ?
You have 2 folders in the zip, "plugins" and "scripts".

1. Put "plugins" in "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2016\bin\"
2. Put "scripts" in "C:\Users\<Your name>\Documents\maya\"
3. Open Maya, go in the top menu Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
4. Click "Browse" and find M2Export.nll.dll
5. In the list, next to M2Export.nll.dll, check "Loaded" and "Auto load"

You can prepare your models using the tools available in the top menu "WoW Tools".

Now, to export a model,
1) Go in the top menu File > Export All and select "World of Warcraft M2" as the export type.
2) Select the expansion you want in the right menu (default is Wrath of the Lich King)
3) Type the file name, like "Frog.m2" and export.

Special thanks to Vellear, who provided many sample models and taught me some Maya basics.
