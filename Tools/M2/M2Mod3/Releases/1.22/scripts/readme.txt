v1.1

First, you should have already installed:

Blender 2.49
www.blender.org

Python 2.6.2
www.python.org


Then, you need to copy the included Python scripts:
BinaryIO.py
export_m2i.py
import_m2i.py


To Blender's scripts directory:
%appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
(you can copy and paste this link into explorer to take you there)
(if you are not on Windows the scripts directory will be somewhere else, google it)
(if you didn't install blender with the installer but just got the zip, the scripts folder will be where you unzipped)


After they have been copied, you will be able to acess them from Blender's "File->Import" and "File->Export" menus.
(if Blender was already running, you will have to restart it to get the scripts to show up in the menus)
