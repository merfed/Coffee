BlpFiletype
===========

This is a Paint.NET filetype plugin for loading (not saving) BLP images as used by several Blizzard games (e.g. World of Warcraft)

The plugin is just a tiny wrapper around the excellent SereniaBLPLib which does the actual BLP file reading.
SereniaBLPLib is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/WoW-Tools/SereniaBLPLib

To install the plugin perform the following steps:
 * Put the DLL in the <Paint.NET>/FileTypes directory (default location is C:\Program Files\paint.net\FileTypes)
 * Restart Paint.NET if you have it open
