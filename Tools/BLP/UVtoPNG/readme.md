This tool prints the UV-Coordinates of a m2-Model to a png.
If you want the Model printed onto a texture, click first "Load Texture", this will  load a blp file and display it.
Then you can click on "Load Model" to load a m2(the *.skin file must be in the same directory!) and print it's UV-Mapping(scaled to the size of the image) to the image. With clicking on "Save UVTexture" you can save the image displayed to a png file.
