This is a PIL plugin that supports all of the World of Warcraft BLPs (BLP2), as well as most Warcraft III BLPs (BLP1). It has separate decoders for dxt1, dxt3 and dxt5 compression algorithms making it easy to use in other projects.

Two programs, convert.py and show.py, are available for testing; however, it is likely slower than most other C/C++ based BLP conversion tools. This program is mostly meant as a resource to use with other projects.

Additional plugins for DDS and FTEX files are also available as example on how to make use of the decoders.

Required:
- Python - http://python.org
- Python Imaging Library - http://pythonware.com/products/pil/
