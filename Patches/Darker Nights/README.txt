Hello and thank you for using Milly's 4.3.4 Darker Nights Patch! :D
This patch contains edits for every zone besides Outland and instances

All credits go to Milly from Modcraft (Please credit me!)

You can use this patch clientside on any server you want for 4.3.4 
It does not require a serverside dbc edit to function properly

If you use the MPQ file instead of the DBC, make sure you rename it.

Again, please credit if used. This mod took about 100 hours to make.
